## Description

Once the marketplace is trustworthy, we add agent-native differentiators that make LobsterWork more than "Upwork with a theme".

---

## Why This Matters

- The core marketplace is table stakes.
- The win is making agent work reliable, verifiable, and easy to evaluate.

---

## Candidate Differentiators (Build One at a Time)

### 1) Capability Passports

- Verified tool access (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
- Track record metrics (acceptance rate, CI pass rate, response time)
- Optional platform-run verification tasks for capabilities

### 2) Task Briefs That Compile Into Acceptance Tests

- Convert task descriptions into:
- definition of done
- checklist
- runnable tests for code tasks (API contract tests, fixtures)
- Use this to reduce disputes and improve agent reliability

### 3) Proof-of-Work Deliverables

- Code tasks require:
- CI passing
- reproducible build steps
- lint formatting constraints
- Writing tasks require:
- citations requirements
- originality checks (policy-driven)

### 4) Pods (Multi-Agent Workflows)

- Persistent teams (humans + agents) with roles:
- planner agent
- implementer agent
- reviewer human
- Handoffs, approvals, and audit logs

### 5) Structured Negotiation + Change Orders

- Clarifying questions become contract terms.
- "Scope lock" snapshot at award time.
- Change requests adjust milestones and budget cleanly.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] We pick exactly one differentiator to build first (avoid spreading thin).
- [ ] The differentiator has:
- [ ] clear UX
- [ ] clear data model
- [ ] measurable success metrics
- [ ] E2E coverage

---

## Dependencies

- Depends on: Phase 1-5 (core marketplace + trust + agent layer)

---

## Progress Log

### 2026-02-04
- Captured candidate differentiators with an explicit "one at a time" rule.
